1 1 When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first 
2 2 birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.

4 4 Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since 
5 5 his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had 
6 6 now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill 
7 7 at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was 
8 8 also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. 
9 9 At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved, 
10 10 but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this 
11 11 was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth 
12 12 as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
